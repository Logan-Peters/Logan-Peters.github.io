I am a PhD student in the CSE department at UCSD. I started in Fall 2020 and did my undergraduate degree in computer science and math at Carleton College. My advisor is Yusu Wang and currently, I work on research relating to optimal transport, neural networks, geometric deep learning, and geometric algorithms/problems.
